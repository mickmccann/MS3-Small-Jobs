# Bugs 

## Mobile Side Nav

- Having a bit of an issue trying to get the mobile side navigation to display when the hamburger menu is tapped.

- It's probably something very small which I'll resolve later.
 
## Footer On Safari

- When viewd live on Safari mobile browser, the footer is not sticking to the bottom and it's not displaying its intended colour. Works fine in Safari on the laptop. [Footer issue image](wireframes/footer_issue.png).
