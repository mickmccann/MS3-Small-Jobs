## About

Small Jobs is a place whereby people can post a small web developing projects. Think of it as a jobs notice board you might find on a wall in your local community hall or college. Its aim is to promote jobs to skilled developers who might have been made redundant due to Covid. So that's the basic idea of Small Jobs, it's not meant to be flashy with all bells and whistles, I'll leave that to LinkedIn.
